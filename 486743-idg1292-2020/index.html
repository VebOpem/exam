                        <p>One of the largest sources of waste types is electronic waste, which in 9 years (2010 - 2019) grew by 38%. 
                                However less than 20% of the total e-waste produced is recycled.

                                E-waste then ends up in landfills in developing countries where workers are exposed to toxic chemicals which shortens their lifespan, drives them in to poverty and renders the surrounding land unusable for generations.

                                Of this, just 17.4 percent was documented to be collected and properly recycled.

                <p class="highligthed">13.8% of food is lost in supply chains</p>
                <p>
                    Food loss is also one of the issues goal twelve takes in to account. 
                    But what is food loss you may ask? It is like food waste which we all know about, but with some 
                    notable differences: 
                </p> 
                <blockquote cite="http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/flw-data)"> <span class="bold">Food loss</span> is the decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions and actions by food suppliers in the chain, excluding retailers, food service providers and consumers.
                    Empirically, it refers to any food that is discarded, incinerated or otherwise disposed of along the food supply chain from harvest/slaughter/catch up to, but excluding, the retail level, and does not re-enter in any other productive utilization, such as feed or seed.
                    Food loss, as reported by FAO in the FLI, occurs from post-harvest up to, but not including, the retail level.
                    </blockquote>
                <blockquote cite="http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/flw-data)"> <span class="bold">Food waste</span> refers to the decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions and actions by retailers, food service providers and consumers.  Food is wasted in many ways:

                    Fresh produce that deviates from what is considered optimal, for example in terms of shape, size and color, is often removed from the supply chain during sorting operations.
                    Foods that are close to, at or beyond the “best-before” date are often discarded by retailers and consumers.
                    Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused or left over and discarded from household kitchens and eating establishments.
                    Less food loss and waste would lead to more efficient land use and better water resource management with positive impacts on climate change and livelihoods.

                    This is however an issue which have been hevily focused on for some years now and good progress has been made in the later years.
