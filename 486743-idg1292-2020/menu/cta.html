            To ensure sustainable consumption and production might seem like a lofty goal and unattainable for school children. 
            But the best way to get this goal on the way is if everyone does a little in areas that affect you directly.  
            So here is a CALL TO ACTION for all the teachers and youth organizers out there. #ggc2021 
        </p>
        <h2>The grand GARBAGE CUP 2021</h2>
